Answer to exercise 1: Roads Module. Chapter 10. Eloquent JS book.

First I would make file named road.js where I save the variable roads 
with all te roads difining the places and the graph from the buildGraph function,
and use module.exports =  buildGraph(roads). Then I would create another file Village.js 
with the import class VillageState() and calling roadGraph=require("road.js"). 
In this manner we are able to have access both the roadGraph and the VillageState 
class. then in order to create the random states and random pick, let's create a
different file named random.js, and to have access to the VillageState class we 
will import VillageState from "./Village" and use exports.module(VillageState.random).
By doing this, we can create different files for every different Robot, for example,
we can include the mailRoute vector and the routeRobot in the same .js file and exporting it
to use this robot in any other program. We can do the same for the findRoute function 
and the GoalOrientedRobot, of course in this last one, we neer to import one more 
roadGraph=require("road.js"). Finally, wherever we need a random VillageState we must call
the random.js file analogously.
